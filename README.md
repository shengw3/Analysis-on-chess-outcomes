# Analysis on Chess Outcomes
The dataset is retrieved from Kaggle.com. We used this data to analyze the outcome of chess games. 
We did some data preprocessing and analyzed it in three aspects. 
1. Modeling the win rate of white vs the difference between ELO rating.
2. Modeling draws and taking user inputs
3. Probabilities of checkmates, resigns and draws

This is a team project with Kevin, Adonis and Cedric. For more information, please refer to the project report.
